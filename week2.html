            <p>Day 4 : On the fourth day, we explored SQL (Structured Query Language) and how to use it to ask specific questions or retrieve specific information from databases. This included learning about queries and filters, which are like search commands for databases.</p>
            <p>The day also involved facing challenges related to SQL. These challenges provided practical scenarios where we could apply our newfound knowledge, reinforcing our skills in crafting effective queries and filters. It was a day dedicated to understanding and using databases more effectively through SQL.</p>

            <p>Day 5 : On day five, we learned about CSS, a cool tool to make our websites look awesome. CSS helps us pick colors, arrange things neatly, and choose fonts for our web pages. It's like giving our websites a stylish makeover, making them not just work well but look great too!</p>
