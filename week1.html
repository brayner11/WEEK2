            <p> Day 1: Introductions to JavaScript and Installations</p>
            <img src="/images/introductionJS.png" alt="Introduction and Installations" width="500" height="300">

            <p>On the first day, we saw a little about how JS works and the platforms that we are going to use to run our code such as visual studio code. They also taught us arrays and dot notations.</p>

            <h3> Arrays</h3>
            <p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value.</p>
            <img src="/images/Arrays.png" alt="Arrays" width="400" height="200">

            <p>We also saw some Arrays methods like:</p>

            <h3> Dot notations</h3>
            <p>Dot notation is the most commonly used notation for accessing object properties. In dot notation, you access an object's property by specifying the object followed by a period and the property name.</p>

            <p> Day 2 : On this day we see an introduction about what coding is and our first employability session</p>

            <p> Day 3 : Variables and Operators/ If Else / Switch /Loops (for/ while)</p>

            <h3>Variables and Operators</h3>
            <img src="/images/variables.png"  alt="variables" width="200" height="100">
            <p>In JavaScript we learned how variables act as containers for storing information, allowing you to assign names to values such as numbers or text. For example, "var age = 25;" creates a variable called 'age' that contains the value 25. Operators, on the other hand, are symbols that perform operations on variables or values. Examples include arithmetic operators such as '+', used for addition, and comparison operators such as '===', which check whether values are equal. These fundamental concepts allow you to efficiently manage and manipulate data in your JavaScript programs.</p>

            <h3>If Else</h3>
            <img src="/images/IfElse.webp"  alt="IF/ELSE" width="200" height="100">
            <p>if and else are conditional statements used for decision-making in your code.</p>

            <h3>Switch</h3>
            <img src="/images/Switch.png"  alt="Switch" width="200" height="100">
            <P>In JavaScript, the switch statement provides a way to perform different actions based on different conditions. It's a concise way to handle multiple cases.</P>
